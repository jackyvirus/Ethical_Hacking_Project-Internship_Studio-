Vulnerability Details
Link identified you are using an out-of-date version of Apache.

For servers, the focus is on stability ? system admin?s usually don't want to update critical server 
software to the newest version as soon as it is released; updates can often break things and they want to wait until 
it is more thoroughly tested before updating, for stability reasons.
Thus, it is common practice to only install security updates immediately, and wait a while before upgrading to a newer release.

Impact
Since this is an old version of the software, it may be vulnerable to attacks.

Mitigation
Please upgrade your installation of Apache to the latest stable version.
